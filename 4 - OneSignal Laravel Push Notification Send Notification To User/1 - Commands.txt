Hereâ€™s how you can handle sending notifications to specific users using OneSignal in a Laravel and Flutter setup:

# https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/sanctum#installation

```
php artisan install:api
```

### 1. **Storing Player IDs in the Database**

Whenever a user logs in or logs out, their OneSignal Player ID needs to be captured and stored in the database.

#### Laravel: Store Player ID on Login
In your Laravel application, when the user logs in, capture their Player ID (passed from Flutter) and store it in the database.

**Migration Example:**
```php
php artisan make:migration add_player_id_to_users_table
```
